Many Traffic APIs were used to acquire this information in real-time. It currently includes accident statistics for the Interconnected United States that were gathered between February 2016 and December 2021.
This dataset contains 10 columns, they are:
1. ID : This serves as the accident record's special identification.
2. Severity : Shows the accident's severity as a number between 1 and 4, with 1 representing
the accident's little impact on traffic (i.e., a brief delay) and 4 representing a major accident
effect on traffic.
3. Start_time : Identifies the accident's start time in local time.
4. End_time : Displays the accident's finish time in local time. The end time in this case refers
to the moment when the accident's effects on traffic were discounted.
5. Start_Lat : Displays the initial point's latitude in GPS coordinates.
6. Start_Lng : Displays the initial point's longitude as a GPS coordinate.
7. End_Lng : Displays the finish point's latitude in GPS coordinates.
8. End_Lat : Displays the finish point's longitude as a GPS coordinate.
9. Distance : The amount to which the collision changed the road's length.
10. Description : Displays an accident description supplied by a person, etc.
This dataset has a total of 49 states that contribute data to this dataset that covers car accidents in the USA. The accident data was gathered using a variety of APIs that provide streaming data about
 
traffic incident (or event) incidents or events over the period of February 2016 to December 2021. This API is used to broadcast traffic data from organizations such as the United States Department of Transportation, state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors embedded in the road networks. These are only a few groups that use these APIs for broadcasting traffic data. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.8 million records in this dataset that pertain to accidents.
